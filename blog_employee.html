                <p>Focusing your HR efforts on your employee retention strategy brings a series of benefits that make it

                <p>But before we get into the nitty-gritty of remote employee retention strategies, let’s talk about the
                    elephant in the room:<br></p>
                <p><em>Why do employees leave?</em><br></p>
                <p>There’s a couple of <a
                        href="https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/news/january-the-most-popular-month-for-job-changes"
                        target="_blank">obvious reasons</a> why someone would leave a company: low pay, negative
                    relationships with their colleagues, looking for a new challenge, wanting to be a part of a
                    different work culture.<br></p>
                <p>But then there’s the reasons we seem to neglect:<br></p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><a href="https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf"

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Remote employee retention strategies aren’t costly and will help you fix all of the issues
                        above. Here’s how.</strong></p>
                <h2>Get your team members involved in projects that will help them shine</h2>
                <p>Learning and development is constantly being referenced as a primary factor to consider when getting
                    and keeping a job. Give your employees a solid role within your company so they won’t hide behind
                    projects they'll never get public credit for.<br></p>
                <p>Putting them face-to-face with a chance to actively contribute to the company’s success keeps them
                    accountable and more engaged.<br></p>
                <p>This can be done in many ways:<br></p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian team has a
                            blog</a> for their developers where team members can showcase their knowledge</li>

                            channel</a></li>
                    <li>The Google search team alternates between hosting <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GoogleSearchCentral/videos" target="_blank">videos and live
                            Q&amp;A sessions</a></li>

                            target="_blank">Academy courses</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Offer tailored benefits</h2>
                <p>We’ve previously gone over some of the fun perks companies offer to stand out in an increasingly
                    competitive talent market.<br></p>
                <p>But where do organizations go wrong?<br></p>
                <p>A few mistakes companies make when providing employee benefits are:<br></p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Failing to customize them to every employee’s need</li>
                    <li>Purchasing benefits that work for your current culture but omitting unconventional options</li>
                    <li>Forgetting to ask employees for their feedback or using enough data before making a purchase
                    </li>
                    <li>Not communicating and promoting the benefit packages to your team</li>
                    <li>Replacing expensive, mandatory benefits with cheaper ones employees might not like</li>
                    <li>Not keeping track of the performance of these benefits<br></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Improve your management</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.panther.co/blog/remote-employee-engagement" target="_blank">In a past
                        article</a>, we talked about how “poor leadership” was one of the main cons employees cited on
                    Glassdoor company pages. And it’s also one of the leading causes for team members leaving
                    organizations that otherwise seem like an ideal place.<br></p>
                <p>The main problem lies with a <a
                        href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/survey-91-percent-of-1000-employees-say-their-boss.html"
                        target="_blank">lack of communication</a> from the leader’s side. What does good team-manager
                    communication look like?&nbsp;<br></p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Holding regular one-on-one meetings to find potential struggles an employee could have</li>
                    <li>Offering clear task instructions and resources</li>
                    <li>Regularly recognizing every team member for their achievements</li>
                    <li>Providing constructive criticism instead of negative feedback</li>
                    <li>Making time to talk to someone without delegating that task or communicating through a
                        third-person</li>
                    <li>Genuinely inquiring about a team member’s health and wellbeing</li>
                    <li>Asking employees for feedback before making a decision or purchase</li>
                </ul>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Another one of the leading duties of a manager is to be a mentor. Starting a mentorship program
                    should be a no-brainer given that <a
                        href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/nine-in-10-workers-who-have-a-mentor-say-they-are-happy-in-their-jobs.html"
                        target="_blank">89% of employees</a> with mentors feel like their work is valued.</p>

                <h2>Show constant recognition for an employee’s achievements, no matter how small</h2>
                <p>To ensure the effectiveness of employee retention strategies you’ll naturally have to focus on the
                    core problems too. Showing recognition is a good place to start.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <p>But don’t just thank your remote team after huge achievements. Recognition comes in multiple forms
                    that span across an employee’s entire lifecycle with your company.<br></p>
                <p>You can show your appreciation by accommodating work schedules and environments to every person,
                    letting your team choose between remote-hybrid-office work attendance, or catering to their
                    professional development needs. Also, ensure your employee recognition programs align with your
                    company’s values and promises to new recruits. For example, if you boasted your reskilling and
                    wellness strategies, focus your main efforts there. These are two of the <a
                        href="https://www.panther.co/blog/future-of-hr" target="_blank">trending HR highlights</a> to
                    keep an eye on in the upcoming years for a good reason: they keep people happy and ensure they enjoy
                    working for your company, limiting the chance of them leaving.<br></p>
                <p>Finally, remember to regularly check in on sentiment with your employees, whether that’s through
                    one-on-ones or engagement surveys. This helps you adapt the strategies you use to reduce employee
                    absenteeism and enhance employee retention for good.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p><strong>Among the things you can ask to guarantee you get their honest thoughts and signs of a
                        potential leave are:&nbsp;</strong><br></p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>How do you feel today in relation to your work and colleagues?</li>
                    <li>Would you recommend our company to your friends as a workplace?</li>
                    <li>What makes you excited about coming to work?</li>
                    <li>Was there ever a time when you felt proud to be a part of your team or projects?</li>
                    <li>What company values resonate with you the most?</li>
                    <li>Are you receiving the recognition you deserve from managers and teammates?</li>
                    <li>Are leadership members involved in your success [development, culture initiatives, etc.]?</li>
                    <li>Do you see yourself working with us after three years?</li>
                    <li>Have you thought of quitting this role at any point? If yes, why?</li>
                    <li>Do you find work processes, workflows, tools, and policies clear?</li>
                    <li>Was there ever a moment when you didn’t feel like you trusted the company, its leaders, or your
                        team members?</li>
                </ul>
